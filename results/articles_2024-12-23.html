      <td id="T_ba783_row0_col3" class="data row0 col3" >OpenAI has awarded a $1 million grant to Duke University's Moral Attitudes and Decisions Lab (MADLAB) for a project called "Making Moral AI". The research team, led by ethics professor Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and co-investigator Jana Schaich Borg, aims to develop a "moral GPS" that could guide ethical decision-making. The project will explore how AI might predict or influence moral judgments, such as ethical dilemmas in autonomous vehicles or business practices. However, the initiative raises questions about who determines the moral framework guiding these tools and whether AI should be trusted to make decisions with ethical implications. The grant will support the development of algorithms that predict human moral judgments in areas like medicine, law, and business.</td>

      <td id="T_ba783_row1_col3" class="data row1 col3" >The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) has recommended a Manhattan Project-style initiative and restrictions on humanoid robots in its latest report to Congress. The report proposes a government-backed program to develop Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), AI systems that could match or exceed human cognitive abilities. The AGI initiative would provide multi-year contracts to leading AI companies, cloud providers, and data center operators, backed by the Defense Department’s highest priority, “DX Rating”. The report also suggests restricting imports of Chinese-made autonomous humanoid robots with advanced capabilities and targets energy infrastructure products with remote monitoring capabilities. The Commission also recommends stronger oversight of technology transfers and investment flows, and the creation of an Outbound Investment Office to prevent US capital and expertise from advancing China’s technological capabilities in sensitive sectors. The report also suggests eliminating China’s Permanent Normal Trade Relations status, which could reshape the technology supply chain and trade flows.</td>

      <td id="T_ba783_row2_col3" class="data row2 col3" >Blockchain, IoT, and AI are converging to redefine industries, according to David Palmer, chief product officer of Pairpoint by Vodafone. Blockchain has evolved from experimental concepts to practical tools, with applications in supply chain management and decentralized finance. IoT devices, expected to number around 30 billion worldwide by 2030, generate vast amounts of data that AI systems can use to provide actionable insights. Blockchain ensures the security and reliability of this data. Digital wallets, expected to grow from 4 billion today to 5.6 billion by 2030, are becoming a cornerstone of this ecosystem. The integration of finance into IoT devices allows for autonomous transactions, while decentralized physical infrastructure networks allow for shared resources. Governments are also exploring the potential of blockchain through Central Bank Digital Currencies and tokenized deposits. The convergence of these technologies could reshape industries and economies by 2030.</td>

He anticipates the integration of large language models with sophisticated agents to perform complex tasks and reduce barriers to interaction. This will make geospatial datasets more accessible and user-friendly. Jethwa also emphasizes the need for ethical considerations in AI development, including creating transparent, fair, and unbiased systems. He highlights the importance of workforce development and retraining to prepare employees for the impact of AI and digital transformation. Despite the potential of these advancements, challenges such as cultural resistance, change fatigue, and cybersecurity threats persist. Jethwa urges companies to develop comprehensive strategies to address these issues and to maintain a clear vision of future goals.</td>
